### Intro on Dynamic programming and recursion

* A good way to look at dynamic programming problems would be in a **bottom-up** approach. 

> Here is a simple illustration of the difference between a top-down and a bottom-up approach.

bottom-up approach | I will learn programming. I will solve simple problems. I will move onto more challenging problems. I will start toy projects and more serious projects. I will become an amazing coder.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
top-down apporach | I will be an amazing coder. How? I will have to make amazing projects. How? I will have to make toy projects first.How to do that? I will have to solve smaller problems first. How? I will have to learn programming.


* Majority of the Dynamic programming problems are either
  * Optimization problems
  * combinatorial problems
